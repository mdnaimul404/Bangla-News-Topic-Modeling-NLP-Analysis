# Bangla-News-Topic-Modeling-NLP-Analysis

An end-to-end R-based system that scrapes Bangla news articles from NTV Bangladesh, performs text preprocessing, visualization, and applies LDA topic modeling to uncover hidden themes and insights.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline on real-world Bangla news data.
It automatically collects articles from NTV Bangladesh, cleans and processes Bangla text, performs frequency analysis, and applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover major discussion topics.

This project is suitable for:

Bangla NLP research

Media and news analysis

Topic modeling and data science applications

Academic and portfolio projects

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

Language: R

Core Libraries:

rvest – Web scraping

dplyr, tidyr, purrr, stringr – Data processing

tm, tokenizers, tidytext – Text mining

wordcloud, RColorBrewer, ggplot2 – Visualization

topicmodels – LDA topic modeling

⚙️ System Workflow

Web Scraping – Collects article links and titles from NTV Bangladesh

Article Extraction – Visits each article link and extracts Bangla news text

Text Preprocessing – Removes punctuation, numbers, English words, and Bangla stopwords

Text Analysis & Visualization – Creates document-term matrix, frequency analysis, and plots

Topic Modeling – Applies LDA with 5 topics and analyzes topic-wise word distributions
